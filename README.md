# Winder Parts
This repository contains a part list and .stl as well as .step files for the current version of the JARVIS WINDER.

## Build the Winder
You are welcome to build your own. You just need a 3D printer and an Amazon account :D However we have no assembly instructions. The process should be pretty self-explanatory though.

We also provide the software for it, which can be found here: https://github.com/QiTech-Industries/Winder

## Improve the Winder
In case you make an improvement to one of the parts which you think may be beneficial for others as well, you are free to open a Pull Request which we are willing to merge into main. Also improvements regarding documentation/assembly instructions are welcome.
- translate the file names and part list to english
- write assembly instructions
- make the CNC Shield screw into the electronic box
- find a better solution for ESD protection than sanding down motors and profiles so they have an electrical connection
- make an excel part list with (possibly with links for buying, automatic BOM generation?)
- make the spool axis not hang from the motor shaft
- create a full CAD model (someone deleted ours :( )
- improve the friction of the puller system
- find an alternative to the TMC based tension control
- whatever you find needs improvement...

## State of the hardware
Like your see: We know that the hardware is not perfect, especially the automatic tension adjustment with the TMC2130 drivers and the friction of the puller rolls harms production. So don't expect wonders. Nevertheless we believe that this can be a good starting point in case you want to build a filament winding machine. I mean at least we successfully produced filament with it.


## No support policy
Please be aware that we can only provide support for customers that purchased a JARVIS WINDER directly from us. We have not enough resources to offer support for people that build their own (like you maybe ;). However we do our best to publish all the documentation we made internally so it should at least be possible to "puzzle" all the parts together yourself. Feel free to improve the documentation if anything has been unclear to you.
